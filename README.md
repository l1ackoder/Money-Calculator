### Currency Counter Script

As a Bug Hunter, I often find myself visiting profiles to assess earnings from public programs. Manually tallying these amounts can be cumbersome, which is why I created this handy script.

#### How It Works
This script automatically scans the webpage for any dollar amounts (formatted with a dollar sign, $) and sums them up in real time.

- **Display**: The total count of dollar amounts found and their cumulative value.
- **Formatting**: If the total exceeds $999, it will display the amount in thousands (e.g., $1,000 will be shown as $1k).

**Example Output**:
Count: 2 | Total: $700

#### Usage
Easily toggle the script on and off with Tampermonkey whenever you need it.
